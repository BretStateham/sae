# Instructions

To run this lab:

- Open the repository in VSCode on a machine that has docker installed
- Open VSCode should prompt you to re-open it in the Dev Container.  Do so.
- If not prompted to open in the Dev Container, in VSCode, press `Ctrl-Shift-P` (for Windows, not sure on mac), and type "**Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**"
- Once the container is built, and the repo is back on in the container (may take some time)
  - Open a new terminal window from the menu, "Terminal/New Terminal"
  - run `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
- Follow the [Sentiment140 Exercise.docx](./Sentiment140%20Exercise.docx) instructions to download the data set.
- Open one of the notebooks, and when you attempt to run a cell, from `Python Environments`, choose the `Python 3.11.11` kernel in `/usr/local/bin/python`:
